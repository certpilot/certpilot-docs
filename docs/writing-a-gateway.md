# Writing a gateway

A gateway is a standalone process that teaches CertPilot how to talk to one
certificate authority. The core knows nothing about ACME, Vault, or any specific
CA — it only knows the gRPC contract in
[`provider.proto`](https://github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/blob/main/proto/provider/v1/provider.proto).

That means a gateway can be written in any language with gRPC support, run
anywhere the core can reach, and be deployed and upgraded independently.

**It goes in your own repository.** There is no `gateways/` directory in the
core to add one to. The three gateways CertPilot maintains each live in a
repository of their own and build against the published module with no
`replace` directive, which is the only real test of whether a contract is
published or merely copied. Nothing about being outside this project makes a
gateway second-class: the core reaches yours the same way it reaches those,
over the network, through the same contract.

The `certpilot-gateway-` prefix is worth keeping. It is what makes a gateway
findable on a GitHub search, and what lets this project point at community
gateways without vouching for them.

## Start with one that answers

Before any of the contract below, get a process running that the conformance
probe can talk to. The whole contract is a lot to read cold; two of its methods
take a few minutes and make the rest concrete.

```bash
mkdir certpilot-gateway-my-ca && cd certpilot-gateway-my-ca
go mod init github.com/you/certpilot-gateway-my-ca
go get github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk
```

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "flag"
    "log/slog"
    "os"

    "github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/grpckit"
    commonv1 "github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/pb/common/v1"
    providerv1 "github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/pb/provider/v1"
    "google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb"
)

// Embedding the generated Unimplemented server is what lets this compile with
// six methods missing: each one answers codes.Unimplemented, which is the
// correct answer for something not written yet rather than a build failure.
type Provider struct {
    providerv1.UnimplementedCertificateProviderServiceServer
}

func (p *Provider) GetCapabilities(
    context.Context, *providerv1.GetCapabilitiesRequest,
) (*providerv1.GetCapabilitiesResponse, error) {
    return &providerv1.GetCapabilitiesResponse{
        Capabilities: &commonv1.ProviderCapabilities{
            ProviderName:      "my-ca",
            ProviderVersion:   "0.1.0",
            ProviderType:      "custom",
            SupportedKeyTypes: []string{"ECDSA"},
            Description:       "Answers metadata; issues nothing yet",
        },
    }, nil
}

func (p *Provider) HealthCheck(
    context.Context, *providerv1.HealthCheckRequest,
) (*providerv1.HealthCheckResponse, error) {
    return &providerv1.HealthCheckResponse{
        Status:    commonv1.HealthStatus_HEALTH_STATUS_HEALTHY,
        CheckedAt: timestamppb.Now(),
    }, nil
}

func main() {
    port := flag.Int("port", 9094, "gRPC port")
    flag.Parse()

    opts := grpckit.DefaultServerOptions()
    opts.Port = *port
    opts.TLS = grpckit.TLSConfig{Insecure: true} // development only

    server, err := grpckit.NewServer(opts)
    if err != nil {
        slog.Error("could not create the server", "error", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    providerv1.RegisterCertificateProviderServiceServer(server, &Provider{})
    if err := grpckit.Serve(server, *port); err != nil {
        slog.Error("gateway stopped", "error", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

Run it, and ask the conformance probe what you have:

```bash
go run . -port 9094 &
go run github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/cmd/conformance@latest \
    -addr localhost:9094 -insecure -domain test.example.com
```

```
provider.v1 conformance — localhost:9094

  ok    GetCapabilities                          my-ca (custom), key types ECDSA
  ok    HealthCheck                              HEALTH_STATUS_HEALTHY
  FAIL  ValidateConfig (rejects malformed JSON)  the call failed: ... not implemented
  --    ValidateConfig (accepts the real one)    skipped: no -config was supplied
  --    GetCAInfo                                skipped: the gateway reports supports_ca_info=false
  FAIL  IssueCertificate                         the call failed: ... not implemented
  FAIL  IssueCertificate (honours csr_pem)       the call failed: ... not implemented

2 passed, 3 failed, 2 skipped, 0 advisory
```

That list is the rest of this page, in the order it is worth doing. The
remainder explains what each of those calls has to return and why.

## The contract

```protobuf
service CertificateProviderService {
  // Lifecycle
  rpc IssueCertificate(IssueCertificateRequest) returns (IssueCertificateResponse);
  rpc RenewCertificate(RenewCertificateRequest) returns (RenewCertificateResponse);
  rpc RevokeCertificate(RevokeCertificateRequest) returns (RevokeCertificateResponse);

  // Status
  rpc GetCertificateStatus(GetCertificateStatusRequest) returns (GetCertificateStatusResponse);
  rpc GetCAInfo(GetCAInfoRequest) returns (GetCAInfoResponse);

  // Metadata
  rpc GetCapabilities(GetCapabilitiesRequest) returns (GetCapabilitiesResponse);
  rpc HealthCheck(HealthCheckRequest) returns (HealthCheckResponse);
  rpc ValidateConfig(ValidateConfigRequest) returns (ValidateConfigResponse);
}
```

Gateways are **stateless with respect to CertPilot's data**. Every request
carries the CA account configuration it needs in `provider_config`, as JSON. The
core stores that configuration encrypted and decrypts it only to populate a
single call.

A gateway may keep its own local state — the ACME gateway persists account keys
in `--state-dir`, because an ACME account must be stable across restarts — but
it never reads CertPilot's database.

## Rules that matter

These are not style preferences. Each one corresponds to a way a gateway can
quietly corrupt the system it plugs into.

**Never report success for work you did not do.** If revocation is not
implemented, return `codes.Unimplemented`. Returning `{success: true}` tells an
operator a compromised certificate is dead when it is live, which is worse than
having no tool at all.

**Return a certificate, or return an error.** `IssueCertificate` must return a
parseable X.509 certificate in `certificate_pem`. The core parses it before
storing and rejects anything else, but a gateway that returns a CSR or a partial
result is broken regardless of what the core catches.

**Return the private key only if you generated it.** When the caller supplies
`csr_pem`, the key lives with whoever made the CSR and must not be invented.
When you do generate one, put it in `private_key_pem` — the core seals it before
storage, and omitting it produces a certificate nobody can use.

**Describe only what you implement.** `GetCapabilities` drives configuration
validation and UI affordances. Advertising `tls-alpn-01` without a solver turns
a clear configuration-time error into a mysterious failure at renewal.

**Validate configuration properly.** `ValidateConfig` runs before a CA account
is saved. Check credentials, reach the CA, and return specific messages. This is
the cheapest possible moment to catch a wrong API token; the alternative is
finding out during an unattended renewal.

**Use meaningful gRPC codes.** The core maps them to retry behaviour:

| Code | Use for |
|:---|:---|
| `InvalidArgument` | Bad request or configuration — do not retry |
| `FailedPrecondition` | Validation failed, no usable challenge — do not retry blindly |
| `ResourceExhausted` | Rate limited — back off |
| `Unavailable` | CA unreachable or timed out — retry later |
| `Internal` | Anything else |

**Never log `provider_config`.** It carries API tokens and account keys.

## A minimal Go gateway

**In your own repository.** There is no longer a `gateways/` directory in the
core to add one to — the three CertPilot maintains each live in a repository of
their own, and so does yours. The contract is a published Go module and the
channel is gRPC over the network, so nothing about being outside this project
makes your gateway second-class.

```bash
mkdir -p certpilot-gateway-my-ca/cmd && cd certpilot-gateway-my-ca
go mod init github.com/you/certpilot-gateway-my-ca
go get github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk
```

Then implement the service:

```go
package myca

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    commonv1 "github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/pb/common/v1"
    providerv1 "github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/pb/provider/v1"
    "github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/x509util"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
    "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
    "google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb"
)

type Config struct {
    Endpoint string `json:"endpoint"`
    APIToken string `json:"api_token"`
}

type Provider struct {
    providerv1.UnimplementedCertificateProviderServiceServer
}

func (p *Provider) IssueCertificate(
    ctx context.Context,
    req *providerv1.IssueCertificateRequest,
) (*providerv1.IssueCertificateResponse, error) {
    cfg, err := parseConfig(req.ProviderConfig)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, err.Error())
    }

    // Ask your CA for a certificate.
    certPEM, chainPEM, err := callYourCA(ctx, cfg, req.CsrPem, req.Domains)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, status.Error(codes.Unavailable, err.Error())
    }

    // Parse what came back rather than trusting it.
    info, err := x509util.ParseCertificatePEM(certPEM)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, status.Error(codes.Internal,
            fmt.Sprintf("CA returned something that is not a certificate: %v", err))
    }

    return &providerv1.IssueCertificateResponse{
        Certificate: &commonv1.CertificateInfo{
            CommonName:        info.CommonName,
            Sans:              info.SANs,
            SerialNumber:      info.SerialNumber,
            IssuerDn:          info.IssuerDN,
            NotBefore:         timestamppb.New(info.NotBefore),
            NotAfter:          timestamppb.New(info.NotAfter),
            KeyType:           info.KeyType,
            KeySize:           int32(info.KeySize),
            FingerprintSha256: info.FingerprintSHA256,
            CertificatePem:    certPEM,
            ChainPem:          chainPEM,
            // PrivateKeyPem only when this gateway generated the key.
        },
        ProviderCertificateId: info.SerialNumber,
    }, nil
}
```

Then the entrypoint. `grpckit` from the gateway SDK handles mTLS, health, and keepalives:

```go
func main() {
    port := flag.Int("port", 9094, "gRPC server port")
    tlsCert := flag.String("tls-cert", "", "this gateway's TLS certificate")
    tlsKey := flag.String("tls-key", "", "this gateway's TLS private key")
    tlsCA := flag.String("tls-ca", "", "CA bundle used to verify the core")
    insecure := flag.Bool("insecure", false, "serve without TLS — development only")
    flag.Parse()

    tlsCfg := grpckit.TLSConfig{
        CertFile: *tlsCert, KeyFile: *tlsKey, CAFile: *tlsCA, Insecure: *insecure,
    }

    opts := grpckit.DefaultServerOptions()
    opts.Port = *port
    opts.TLS = tlsCfg

    server, err := grpckit.NewServer(opts)
    if err != nil {
        slog.Error("failed to create gRPC server", "error", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    providerv1.RegisterCertificateProviderServiceServer(server, &myca.Provider{})

    if err := grpckit.Serve(server, *port); err != nil {
        slog.Error("gateway failed", "error", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

## Transport security

The core-to-gateway channel carries CSRs, private keys, and CA credentials, so
it is mutually authenticated by default: TLS 1.3, both ends verified against a
shared CA, `RequireAndVerifyClientCert` on the server.

For development, `make dev-certs` writes usable material into `.certpilot/pki/`.
In production, issue the gateway a certificate from your own internal CA and
point `--tls-ca` at that CA. `--insecure` exists for local work and is refused
by the core in production mode.

Non-Go gateways need the same: TLS 1.3, client certificate required, verified
against the CertPilot control-plane CA.

## Testing

Test the provider directly — it is a plain gRPC service, so no server is needed:

```go
func TestIssueRejectsBadConfig(t *testing.T) {
    p := &Provider{}
    _, err := p.IssueCertificate(context.Background(), &providerv1.IssueCertificateRequest{
        Domains:        []string{"example.com"},
        ProviderConfig: `{"endpoint": ""}`,
    })
    if status.Code(err) != codes.InvalidArgument {
        t.Fatalf("code = %s, want InvalidArgument", status.Code(err))
    }
}
```

Worth covering explicitly, because these are the failure modes that damage the
core rather than just failing:

- Missing or malformed `provider_config`
- A CA that returns something that is not a certificate
- Whether unimplemented operations return `Unimplemented` rather than success
- That `GetCapabilities` lists only what is actually implemented

[`certpilot-gateway-selfsigned`](https://github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-selfsigned) is the smallest complete
example. [`certpilot-gateway-acme`](https://github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-acme) is the realistic public-CA one:
challenge solvers, persistent account state, External Account Binding, and RFC
9773 renewal information. [`certpilot-gateway-vault`](https://github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-vault) is the private-CA
one, and the only gateway that implements `GetCAInfo` — worth reading for how it
translates a CA's own refusals into sentences that name the cause, and for the
live test suite that runs against a real Vault rather than a stub.

## Wanted gateways

In rough order of demand: Microsoft AD CS, AWS Private CA, Google Cloud CAS,
EJBCA, DigiCert, Sectigo, Entrust, and step-ca. HashiCorp Vault PKI is
[built](https://github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-vault).

The private-CA gateways are also where post-quantum issuance is possible today —
AWS Private CA has had ML-DSA generally available since November 2025, while
publicly trusted ACME CAs cannot issue post-quantum certificates at all yet.

## Check it before you trust it

```bash
go run github.com/certpilot/certpilot-gateway-sdk/cmd/conformance@latest \
    -addr localhost:9094 -insecure -domain test.example.com
```

The three gateways in this project are kept honest by live tests against a real
Vault and a real ACME server, which you cannot run. This is the substitute: it
makes real calls against your gateway and prints what it got wrong.

The check to read first is `IssueCertificate (honours csr_pem)`. It generates a
CSR, asks you to sign it, and compares the public key in the certificate you
return against the key it asked you to sign. A gateway that generates its own
key instead passes every test its author is likely to write, and fails much
later as a certificate that does not match its private key.

## Registering it with a core

A gateway is reachable over the network, so the core does not need to have heard
of it and there is no plugin registry to be listed in. Registering one is
*almost* a single call — read the next paragraph before you make it, because
`provider_type` is not a free-text field yet and the failure if you treat it as
one is worse on Postgres than it is against the in-memory store used in
development, which is exactly the shape of mistake that reaches production
undetected.

**`provider_type` is constrained today.** `ca_accounts.provider_type` carries a
`CHECK` constraint naming a fixed list — `acme`, `vault`, `selfsigned`, `gcp_cas`,
`aws_pca`, `digicert`, `sectigo`, `step_ca` at the time of writing, in
`migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`. A value outside that list is accepted by the
in-memory store (which enforces nothing) and refused by PostgreSQL with a bare
constraint-violation error, which is not a message anyone can act on. If your CA
is already in the list — several are there for gateways not yet built — skip
ahead; your `provider_type` already works. If it is not, add it with a short
migration before you register anything:

```sql
-- migrations/0NN_my_ca_provider.sql
begin;

alter table public.ca_accounts drop constraint if exists ca_accounts_provider_type_check;
alter table public.ca_accounts add constraint ca_accounts_provider_type_check
    check (provider_type in ('acme', 'vault', 'selfsigned', 'gcp_cas', 'aws_pca',
                              'digicert', 'sectigo', 'step_ca', 'my-ca'));

commit;
```

Drop and re-add rather than try to alter the constraint's check expression in
place, which PostgreSQL does not support —
`migrations/022_agent_installs.sql` and `migrations/024_cloud_deployers.sql` both
widen `deployment_targets_target_type_check` this same way, and are the
precedent this pattern is copied from. Run it, then register the account with
your own `provider_type` in place of `my-ca`:

> These examples carry `-b "$JAR"`, a cookie jar from signing in. There is no
> anonymous mode, so a command without a credential is a 401. See
> [Authentication](/api/#from-the-command-line) for the one-liner
> that fills it, or substitute `-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"`.

```bash
curl -b "$JAR" -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/ca-accounts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "name": "my-custom-ca",
    "provider_type": "my-ca",
    "gateway_addr": "gateway-my-ca.internal:9094",
    "server_name": "gateway-my-ca.internal",
    "config": {"endpoint": "https://ca.internal", "api_token": "..."}
  }'
```

The core connects, calls `GetCapabilities`, then `ValidateConfig`. If validation
fails nothing is stored and the errors come back to the operator, which is why
`ValidateConfig` is worth implementing properly — it is the last moment a wrong
API token is a message on a screen rather than a failed renewal at three in the
morning.

`config` is whatever your gateway expects. The core stores it encrypted, never
inspects it, and hands it back as `provider_config` on every call.

**What CertPilot will not do for you:** there is no discovery mechanism, and no
compatibility testing of gateways this project does not build. The conformance
probe above is what you have, and it is deliberately the same one the three
in-house gateways run in their own CI.
